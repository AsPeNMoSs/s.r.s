## What is the Software Requirements Specification (SRS)? <a href="#7f86" id="7f86"></a>

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document explaining how and what the software/system will do. It defines the features and functionality that the product requires to satisfy all stakeholders’ (business, users) needs.

A standard SRS includes:

* A goal/purpose
* A summary of the whole process
* Specific Requirements

The best SRS documents describe how the program communicates with the embedded hardware or specific software with unique coding culture. The chosen real-life users also account for nice SRS documents.

## What does an SRS document contain? <a href="#47d2" id="47d2"></a>

A **** typical SRS document describes all the software requirements and sometimes even contains a collection of use cases that describe the user interactions needed by the software.

It defines the purpose of a software project, provides the overall definition and specifications of its features.

In general, SRS documents contain three kinds of program requirements:

* _**Functional specifications** that include measures to be performed by the system_
* _**Non-functional**  **requirements** determining the software system’s performance attributes_
* _**Domain requirements** that are device limits on the service domain_
