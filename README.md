## What is the Software Requirements Specification (SRS)? <a href="#7f86" id="7f86"></a>

A software requirements specification (SRS) is a document explaining how and what the software/system will do. It defines the features and functionality that the product requires to satisfy all stakeholdersâ€™ (business, users) needs.

A standard SRS includes:

* A goal/purpose
* A summary of the whole process
* Specific Requirements

The best SRS documents describe how the program communicates with the embedded hardware or specific software with unique coding culture. The chosen real-life users also account for nice SRS documents.
